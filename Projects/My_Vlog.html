    <p> I haven't meet with my friends since the matriculation exam finished. Because of covid cases were in my country, the government announce "<em><strong>Stay at Home</strong></em>" statement. Now the covid cases are getting controlled and it is the end of first covid wave. So, our teachers announce that they will held a reunion those who have passed exam with flying colors.</p>
    <p>
        I was so excited to meet with my friends again. I met with all my friends(those who are close to me during my school life). We all gave greetings and talk with our teachers. Then, I spent time with my friends, talking about how they were managing themselves during covid period.  I didn't even notice it was around 2pm. So we went for a lunch at KFC. We continued conversation there and then, we went shopping. We bought so many stuffs and tooking selfies. Finally, we part and I arrived home in the evening. It was a great day.

    <p>Today, I have my zoom meeting with my online english class. Since Hallowen is drawing near, I have to wear hallowen costumes to attend the class. So, I have a big mission; what to wear for hallowen? I haven't even wear hollowen costumes  once. Thanks to my friends, I was able to fineed a solution. They dress up me like like a little white ghost. So, I am ready for the class and it is evening now. I enter the ZOOM link.</p>
    <p>
        When I enter the online class, I see my classmates with hallowen outfits. Each of them has its unique design. Some decorate with clothes and some decorate with make-up. My techer(Mrs.Amy) explains what a hallowen party is, the history of the hallowen and how the western people celebrate the hallowen party. Then, she makes fun games that are related to hallowen and a few quizes for the students. At last, she ends the meeting with hallowen songs.

    <p>Today is Happy New Years Eve. My Running group has a plan to run 21km from Inya Lake to Yangon International Airpot. When we arrive airpot, we will will head back to Inya Lake. That is 21km (half-marathon) distance. We all agreed that we will meet at 5am at the Inya Lake. It is hard for me to wake up early but I managed to arrive in time. When I arrive there, I have a little chit-chat with all my group members. Some people run for health and some are athletes who have won medals.There is also an athlete who have won gold medal at SEA Games in our group.</p>
    <p>Now we start running. It,s really good to run in the early. The cool breeze is giving energy to keep running. There are only a few cars on the road. So, I can run in the middle of the road. Since it's winter, the night time is really long. lt's still dark outside though it's 6:20am already. When I get tired and I want to take a break, my mentor encourage me to go on. 1 hour later, I have reached the airport. Then, we take group photos and head back to the start point. At that time, I am really exhausted and don't want to keep running. But I have already decided to run 21km so I push my limits and keep running. As the finishing line gets closer, my legs are getting more and more tingling. But finally, I made it to the end. I am so happy. I feel like the fastest man in the world at that moment. Other members praise at me too.  </p>
    <p>After the run, we have dumpling and isotonic drink as our breakfast. We take a lot more group photos and selfies again. At 8pm, all of us have a parting and go back to home. That is a great achievement for me today</p>
