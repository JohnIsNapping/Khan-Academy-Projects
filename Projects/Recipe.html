        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until the juice has evaporated, and the mushrooms are browned, about 15 minutes. Set mushrooms aside.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Fluff cooked rice with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to separate the grains. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, garlic, and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute; add celery, onion, and carrot. Cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in red bell pepper and cooked mushrooms just until combined.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Stir in cooked rice, lightly tossing until rice is heated through and thoroughly combined with pork and vegetables. Stir in soy sauce, remove from heat, and sprinkle green onions over the top.</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Bring a saucepan three-fourths full of water to a boil over high heat. Add the salt and chicken and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is opaque throughout, 10 to 15 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a plate and let cool. Shred the chicken and set aside.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Meanwhile, place the sausages in a small saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to low and simmer the sausages for 5 minutes to render the fat. Drain and let cool. Cut the sausages on the diagonal into slices 1/8 inch thick and set aside.
</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>In a small bowl, stir together the broth, fish sauce, soy sauces and sugar. Set the stir-fry sauce aside.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Heat a large wok or fry pan over high heat until very hot. Add the sausage slices to the hot pan and stir-fry until crisp and brown on the edges, about 1 minute. Add the shrimp and stir-fry until the shrimp just turn opaque, about 30 seconds. Transfer the sausage and shrimp to a bowl. Return the pan to high heat and add 1 Tbs. of the oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic, yellow onion and carrot and stir-fry until just tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the sausage and shrimp.</p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Wipe the pan clean, return it to high heat and add the remaining 1 Tbs. oil. When the oil is hot, add the noodles and stir-fry until they begin to dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the vegetables, sausage and shrimp to the pan, add the cabbage and chicken, and stir-fry until the cabbage begins to wilt and the chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour in the sauce and stir-fry until most of the sauce has been absorbed and the noodles have plumped and are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
</p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Transfer the noodles to a warmed platter or bowl and garnish with the green onions. Serve immediately and pass the lemon wedges at the table. Serves 4 to 6.
